# You will practice the following 
learn how to enable containers to communicate with the outside world by exposing and mapping ports.
### how run your first web server (httpd) container
### how run your first web server (httpd) container in a detached mode
- Run httpd container
```bash

```

```bash
./02-run-httpd-container-d.sh
