# You will practice the following 
## how to build containe images
## how to explore image layers
## how to optimize container image size
- build a container image using Dockerfile
```bash
./01-build-image.sh
```
- build the same image using different Dockerfile [under better/Dockerfile]
```bash
./02-build-better-image.sh
```
- Compare image size and image layer for each image
```bash
./03-compare-layers.sh
```
- Extra : use dive to navigate through content of each layer [Added, Removed, Updaed content]
This is a homework!
